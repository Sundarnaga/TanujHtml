            <h4>Indoraptor is a hybrid similar to the Indominus rex. It's head resembles a Tyrannosaurus rex with a more
                pointed
                snout. Like crocodilians it sports rows of scutes along its back with thinner, smaller scales covering
                the
                body. It
                also bears feathers in the form of quills along the back of its head and dorsum.

            <h1>Speed and Velocity</h1>
            <p>
                The Indoraptor can run at high speeds, despite being heavy on the front. It was what works on all four
                arms
                when
                accelerating, similar to a panther.
                It can run up to 25m per hour.

            <h1>Intelligence</h1>
            <p>
                It's intelligence could be equally or bit higher then Velociraptor or the Indominus rex.
                He had shown that when it was hit by tranquilizer shots it went down though
                it was playing with its prey to lure him in to kill
            </p>
            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <p>
                The indoraptor is a hybird similar to the
                indominus rex. It's head resembles a Tyrannosaurus rex with a more pointed snout.
                Like crocodilians it sports rows of scutes along its back with thinner, smaller scales covering the
                body.
                It also bears feathers in the form of quills along the back of its head and dorsum.
                The overall build is very elongated with a very long tail and neck.
                Unlike any other Theropod in the franchise, it often runs on all fours

            <h1>Behavior</h1>
            The Indoraptor was a dangerous, aggressive and hostile dinosaur. Due to its advanced intelligence but lack
            of socialization it exhibits sociopathic and homicidal tendencies.

            Though Indoraptor had mean't Maisie for the first time could have try to easily killed her but instead just
            stroked her hair to understand what she was to him.
            Even when he seems to be hunting her over her roof and he walked in the bedroom and reach out for her slowly
            possibly understanding she isnâ€™t human could be the reason why he never meant to hurt her.

            <p>
            <h1>abilities</h1>
            The Indoraptor was stated to be the most dangerous creature that ever walked the planet.
            Granted this was mostly said to show him off to potential buyers but he is still a
            formidable monster.
            </p>
            <h1>strength and combat</h1>
            The Indoraptor is significantly stronger than most medium-size theropods, being able to climb down
            vertically despite being well over a ton as well as being able to sprint at
            high speeds while carrying two adult men.
            It was proven to handle well against female raptor-like Blue as he was able to toss her away from his feet.
            Dr. Wu stated that the Indoraptor we see (Nicknamed Hot Rod) was a prototype
            <p>

            <h1>stamina and durability</h1>
            Its durable body is able to take the attacks of Blue and bullets from Owen that had used though it was shown
            to get back up easily.
            Whereas a Velociraptor can be felled by a well-placed handgun bullet, the Indoraptor casually shrugged off
            high powered rifle fire
            to the point the bullets can be audibly heard dropping out of its hide.
            </p>
            <h1>senses and Echolocation</h1>
            He posses a great sense of smell being able to track Maisie in her room, from outside, while raining.
            With great vision to see in the dark for having night vision. It had the ability to find prey
            as it was possible to find Owen and the girls behind the glass.
            <p>
            <h1>climber</h1>
            Unknown if he able to stick walls but proven to be great climber but
            possibly from its sharp claws was able to hold on to walls.
            </p>
            <h1>jaw strength</h1>
            Unknown if he able to stick walls but proven to be great climber but
            possibly from its sharp claws was able to hold on to walls.
